## [Unreleased]

### 🧪 Next

- **UX overhaul sprint (Phase 7.6)**
  - Stabilized design-token pass and mobile app shell navigation (bottom nav + account-only mobile drawer).
  - Added direct card quick actions (Watchlist + Log) to key discovery surfaces and mobile movie cards.
  - Applied Oracle hero treatment and profile top-metrics simplification for clearer hierarchy.
  - Upgraded Watch History into a photographic calendar: active days now surface poster-backed day tiles while preserving click-to-drill timeline details.
  - Added a Founders presentation surface in Filmgraph Hub with launch-oriented positioning, perk callouts, and premium badge preview treatment.
  - Added subtle motion/microinteraction polish to `WatchHistory` (active-day pulse, staggered day-card entry, reduced-motion safeguards).
  - Added shared motion tokens and a broader microinteraction sweep across core shell surfaces (button press states, card hover elevation, mobile nav feedback, and Discovery card/button transitions).
- **UPC cache reliability layer (Phase 7.7)**
  - Added `upc_cache` migration scaffold for read-through caching of barcode lookup payloads.
  - Wired cache-first behavior into `api/upc-lookup` with fail-soft upsert semantics.
  - Added TTL-based cache aging + stale fallback handling so older UPC entries refresh automatically while still returning cached data during upstream errors/timeouts.
  - Added optional server-side Supabase env documentation for cache operations.
- **Pre-launch bug squash (v1.12.14)**
  - Refactored Oracle recommendation rendering into `OracleContext` + `ResultCard` and fixed reroll regression so single-card rerolls replace only the targeted recommendation instead of globally refreshing the entire set.
  - Added Oracle streaming context badges by mapping TMDB provider logos and rendering matched `user_providers` directly on each result card.
  - Added list-membership race guard migration (`list_members` dedupe + unique index on `list_id,user_id`) and hardened shared-list API writes with `upsert(..., { onConflict: 'list_id,user_id' })`.
- **Oracle intelligence pass (Phase 7.9)**
  - Added post-generation recommendation guardrails in `src/utils/gemini.js` to normalize output, remove duplicates, and enforce rejected-title exclusion before cards render.
  - Added quality-floor enforcement so thin model output is topped up with deterministic TMDB fallback picks to preserve stable recommendation sets.
  - Applied the same quality guardrail pass across both Gemini and OpenRouter Oracle response paths for more consistent discovery behavior.
  - Upgraded Oracle taste-context hydration in `src/context/OracleContext.jsx` to derive user vibe signals from moods, genres, rating polarity, decade preference, and recent behavior before prompt assembly.
  - Expanded taste weighting with deterministic mood/genre affinity scoring (frequency + bounded recency + high-rating lift), rating polarity buckets, and strict per-section caps to keep prompt context stable for large libraries.
  - Added explicit avoid-like guidance from low-rated watched logs (`<= 2.5`) and ensured it remains in the Oracle context even when slices are truncated.
  - Added Oracle weighting regression tests validating weighted context sections and avoid-like truncation behavior in `tests/oracle-query-intelligence.spec.ts`.
  - Added Supabase RPC `get_oracle_taste_profile(p_user_id)` for server-side Oracle context hydration, then wired Oracle to use RPC-first with fail-soft fallback to local taste aggregation when RPC is unavailable.
  - Added feature-flagged low-latency Groq intent parsing for Oracle query constraints (`VITE_FEATURE_ORACLE_GROQ_INTENT_PARSER=true`) with deterministic parser fallback to preserve reliability.
  - Added Oracle constraint resolver tests covering Groq success/fallback behavior and RPC-compatible context ordering assertions.
  - Documented rollout toggles in `.env.example` for Oracle RPC hydration (`VITE_FEATURE_ORACLE_TASTE_RPC`) and Groq constraint parsing (`VITE_FEATURE_ORACLE_GROQ_INTENT_PARSER`).
  - Added a ranked `Now / Next / Later` execution order in `ROADMAP.md` for deferred Oracle upgrades (filter intelligence, reliability, media expansion, and polish tracks).
  - Implemented Sprint A query intelligence: Oracle now parses compound prompt constraints (year bounds, genre hints, watch-status intent), passes deterministic `queryConstraints` through orchestration, and applies year/genre-aligned fallback filtering.
  - Added safety toggle `VITE_FEATURE_ORACLE_QUERY_CONSTRAINTS` so constraint behavior can be enabled without removing legacy Oracle flow.
  - Added parser validation coverage in `tests/oracle-query-intelligence.spec.ts` including prompts like “pre-1960 horror on my watchlist”.
  - Implemented Sprint C reliability hardening: provider-specific timeout/retry contracts (`Gemini/OpenRouter=9000ms`, `TMDB=6000ms`) with deterministic fallback progression across Gemini -> OpenRouter -> TMDB.
  - Added abort-aware Oracle request orchestration in `OracleContext` so rerolls/new discovery/unmount cancel in-flight work and ignore stale late responses.
  - Added UI-safe fallback payload normalization to guarantee non-empty `rationale` and `vibeCheck` fields when metadata fallback paths are used.
  - Expanded Oracle failure observability with normalized `failure_bucket` (`rate_limit`, `parse_fail`, `timeout`, `upstream_unavailable`, `unknown`) and additive `failure_stage` tags for Supabase analytics compatibility.
  - Added additive `oracle_provider_events` migration coverage for `failure_bucket` and `failure_stage` so runtime telemetry fields remain schema-safe.
  - Added reliability regression coverage for bucket mapping, retry policy boundaries, fallback shape safety, and abort classification in `tests/oracle-query-intelligence.spec.ts`.
  - Expanded `oracle_provider_events` telemetry with additive hybrid metrics fields: `input_recommendation_count`, `post_filter_recommendation_count`, `dedupe_dropped_count`, `rejected_violation_attempt_count`, `provider_attempt_count`, `fallback_depth`, and `provider_attempts` JSON.
  - Wired Oracle analytics payload mapping to persist expanded `_meta.qualityMetrics` and `_meta.attemptMetrics` safely while preserving legacy payload compatibility when telemetry blocks are absent.
  - Added reroll-one analytics persistence and failure-path telemetry carry-through so discover/reroll flows both emit provider-attempt detail.
  - Persisted provider-selection and ranking impact telemetry in `oracle_provider_events` (`selected_provider_ids`, `provider_match_count`, `provider_filtered_out_count`) while keeping payload defaults backward-compatible.
  - Added deterministic provider-aware recommendation ranking after TMDB/provider enrichment so provider-matched cards are promoted first without hiding non-matches.
  - Kept reroll-one index replacement behavior intact while applying ranking to full discover/reroll-all flows only.
  - Extended Oracle query-intelligence tests with telemetry payload coverage for metric mapping, provider-attempt normalization, fallback-depth behavior, and backward compatibility.
  - Added ranking regression coverage for deterministic provider promotion and no-preferences pass-through ordering.

## [1.12.23] - May 13, 2026

### Changed

- **Oracle / Gemini:** Reordered the Gemini model ladder to try **`gemini-2.0-flash` before `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`** for lower typical latency; **`gemini-3.1-flash-lite`** remains next in the chain so API keys that lack 2.0 or hit 2.0-only errors still get a modern GA fallback, followed by the existing 2.x / 1.5 model IDs before downstream OpenRouter and TMDB fallbacks.

---

## [1.12.22] - May 12, 2026

### Changed

- **Oracle:** Gemini ladder now tries **`gemini-3.1-flash-lite` (GA)** first, with existing Gemini 2.x / 1.5 model IDs as fallbacks when a candidate is unavailable or errors (Google preview retirement).

---

## [1.12.21] - May 6, 2026

### Fixed

- **Trending cards:** The two quick actions looked like duplicate “+” buttons; **Add to list** now uses a **list** icon and **Log** uses a **pencil** icon, with clearer `aria-label`s on icon-only controls.
- **Add-to-list menu clipped:** Parent cards used `overflow: hidden`, which cut off the list dropdown (truncated text like “…movies”). Trending **backdrop images** are clipped inside `.backdrop-media-clip` only; search **movie posters** use `.movie-card-poster-clip` the same way so the card no longer clips the menu. Narrow screens use a safer dropdown width (`min(280px, 100vw - padding)`).

---

## [1.12.20] - May 6, 2026

### Changed

- Removed the **Creepster** display font (Google Fonts + `.font-creepster` utility). Page titles and the “Signal Lost” empty state now use the app’s system sans stack; **Matchmaker** and **Profile** social headings match the rest of the UI.

---

## [1.12.19] - May 6, 2026

### Fixed

- **Year in Review / Supabase:** Stopped selecting `movie_logs.watched_at` until the column exists. Recap dates use `created_at` from the query; `buildYearInReview` still supports `watched_at` on the log object when present (e.g. after migration). Added migration `20260507120000_movie_logs_watched_at.sql` to add optional `watched_at` for future use.

---

## [1.12.18] - May 6, 2026

### Added

- **Year in Review (Phase 6.8)** — Profile links to **`/year-in-review`**, a wrapped-style recap by calendar year: films watched (status watched + hybrid log dates), monthly counts, rating distribution and average (rated logs only), top genres and moods, physical UPC count, and reviews written. Year picker covers 2015–current year; optional URL **`/year-in-review/:year`**. Aggregation is client-side via **`buildYearInReview`** in `src/utils/yearInReview.js`. See **`artifacts/adr-year-in-review.md`** for date and metric rules.

---

## [1.12.17] - May 6, 2026

### Fixed

- **Oracle Discovery**: Single-card **Reroll** now invokes `handleRerollByTmdbId` from context (previously referenced an undefined `onRerollByTmdbId`, which threw at runtime when rerolling one recommendation).

### Changed

- **ESLint**: Ignore Capacitor `android/**` and `public/sw.js` so `npm run lint` does not parse generated native bundles or the service worker as generic scripts. Added global `settings.react.version` (`detect`) to silence redundant React plugin warnings.
- Tidied unused destructuring names in shared-list list-item fallbacks (`sharedLists.js`, `ArchiveImporterModal.jsx`) so lint stays warning-clean for those paths.

---

## [1.12.16] - May 6, 2026

### Added

- **Library Advanced Search (Phase 6.10)** — On **Library** → **Find & refine**, open **Advanced search** to combine mood chips (palette-aligned, any/all moods), genre checkboxes from your logged TMDB genres, and min/max **your rating** (0–5, 0.5 steps). Filters apply to the current shelf (Watched, Watchlist, or Collection) and respect title search, smart filter, and sort. Global TMDB **Search** is unchanged.

---

## [1.12.15] - April 29, 2026

### 🛠️ Changed

- **Oracle intelligence integration pass (Phase 7.9)**
  - Merged Sprint B taste-weighting upgrades and Sprint C reliability hardening into one release-ready branch.
  - Preserved RPC-first taste hydration (`get_oracle_taste_profile`) with deterministic local fallback (`buildUserTasteProfile` / `buildTasteContextString`).
  - Preserved Groq intent parsing fast-path with deterministic query parser fallback for Oracle constraints.
  - Added provider-specific reliability controls in Oracle orchestration (timeouts, bounded retries, abort-safe reroll/discover flow, and deterministic fallback sequencing).
  - Added normalized failure telemetry buckets/stage tagging for `oracle_provider_events` compatibility and observability.
  - Kept UI-safe recommendation payload normalization for fallback paths (`rationale` / `vibeCheck` always present).

### ✅ Quality

- Combined Oracle regression suite passes: `npx playwright test "tests/oracle-query-intelligence.spec.ts"`.
- Production build succeeds: `npm run build`.
- Release metadata synced to `v1.12.15` across `package.json`, `src/constants.js`, and roadmap current-version status.

---

## [1.12.12] - April 28, 2026

### 🚀 Added

- **Bug report admin email notifications (Resend)**
  - Added a secure Vercel serverless endpoint at `api/notify-bug-report.js` to send bug-report alert emails via Resend using server-side environment variables.
  - Added fail-soft frontend notifier helper in `src/api/adminNotifications.js` to call the new endpoint without exposing any secret keys.

### 🛠️ Changed

- **Bug report submission flow**
  - Updated `BugReportModal` bug submit pipeline to fetch inserted row metadata and trigger an admin notification email after a successful `bug_reports` insert.
  - Notification failures no longer impact user success UX; they are logged as warnings while preserving successful report submission.
- **Environment setup documentation**
  - Added server-only env var placeholders in `.env.example`: `RESEND_API_KEY`, `BUG_REPORT_FROM_EMAIL`, and `BUG_REPORT_ADMIN_EMAIL`.

### ✅ Quality

- Kept notification delivery fail-soft so product bug intake remains reliable even if Resend is temporarily unavailable or not configured.

---

## [1.12.11] - April 28, 2026

### 🛠️ Changed

- **Auth email deliverability UX**
  - Added explicit spam/promotions-folder guidance to password-reset flow in `LoginPage` helper and success messaging.
  - Added the same spam/promotions guidance to signup flow success messaging and email field helper copy in `RegisterPage`.
- **Release metadata sync**
  - Aligned app/package versions and roadmap pointer for this UX pass.

### ✅ Quality

- Verified no linter issues in updated auth pages after copy and style updates.

---

## [1.12.10] - April 28, 2026

### 🛠️ Changed

- **Primary-domain SEO hardening**
  - Updated SEO defaults/canonical fallback from `filmgraph.vercel.app` to `filmgraph.app` in the shared head component.
  - Updated crawler metadata to the primary domain (`robots.txt` sitemap URL + sitemap generator default URL).
  - Regenerated `public/sitemap.xml` against `https://filmgraph.app`.
  - Updated launch artifact links to point at the primary domain.

### ✅ Quality

- Domain property is now aligned across head/crawler/link surfaces for Search Console indexing consistency.

---

## [1.12.9] - April 28, 2026

### 🚀 Added

- **SEO discoverability foundation**
  - Added route-level SEO head management with `react-helmet-async` and reusable `SeoHead` component.
  - Added dynamic titles/descriptions/canonical/OG/Twitter tags on key routes (Trending, Search, Discovery, Library, Movie Detail).
  - Added `Movie` JSON-LD schema on `MovieDetail` with title/year/poster/overview plus Filmgraph mood/rating properties when available.
- **Crawler assets + sitemap automation**
  - Added `public/robots.txt` with sitemap declaration.
  - Added sitemap generation script (`scripts/generate-sitemap.mjs`) and npm command `seo:sitemap`.
  - Generated `public/sitemap.xml` from static routes with optional dynamic movie ID support via `SITEMAP_MOVIE_IDS`.
- **Launch content artifact pack**
  - Added reusable launch/reply templates under `artifacts/launch/` for Reddit/Facebook/community posting workflows.

### 🛠️ Changed

- **Shared list reliability**
  - Added adapter-backed `deleteList` API in `src/api/sharedLists.js` and moved UI deletion flow onto that single path.
  - Updated library list deletion to use context adapter flow instead of duplicated direct Supabase calls.
  - Added duplicate list-name guard in shared list creation to prevent accidental repeated list creation by the same user.

### ✅ Quality

- Verified sitemap generation (`npm run seo:sitemap`) and production build (`npm run build`) succeed after SEO integration.

---

## [1.12.8] - April 27, 2026

### 📚 Documentation

- **NotebookLM grounding bundle**
  - Added `artifacts/architecture-overview.md` — top-down system map (client, Supabase, Vercel functions, external APIs, AI orchestration) for grounding NotebookLM Q&A.
  - Added `artifacts/data-model.md` — Supabase schema reference covering `profiles`, `movie_logs`, `lists` family, `oracle_provider_events`, RLS principles, and chronological migration index.
  - Added `artifacts/failure-modes.md` — battle-scar catalog with 12 high-signal regressions (mobile camera black preview, UPC CORS, stale Vite/SW caches, env drift, native secure-context, enrichment crashes, etc.) and a template for adding new entries.
- Joined the existing `artifacts/barcode-scanner-implementation-summary.md` to form a complete NotebookLM source set: architecture + schema + failure modes + feature deep-dive.

### ✅ Quality

- Version bump (`1.12.7` → `1.12.8`) reflects documentation surface area only — no runtime behavior changes.

---

## [1.12.7] - April 27, 2026

### 🚀 Added

- **Streaming-aware Oracle preferences**
  - Added user streaming provider preferences (`user_providers`) with profile/discovery multi-select controls.
  - Added provider-aware Oracle verification metrics columns for analytics (`selected_provider_ids`, `provider_filtered_out_count`, `provider_match_count`).
- **Optional API enrichment scaffold**
  - Added feature-flag controls for editorial, visual, and Trakt enrichments (`VITE_FEATURE_EDITORIAL_ENRICHMENT`, `VITE_FEATURE_VISUAL_ENRICHMENT`, `VITE_FEATURE_TRAKT_ENRICHMENT`).
  - Added non-blocking enrichment adapters for Wikipedia, NYT Top Stories (Movies), Fanart.tv, and Trakt movie matching.
  - Added `MovieDetail` optional enrichment cards that render only when enrichment data is available.

### 🛠️ Changed

- **Oracle provider filtering + watch-now flow**
  - Discovery now persists/uses provider selections, verifies TMDb watch providers per recommendation, and filters suggestions to matching services when configured.
  - Added provider badge surfacing and `Watch Now` deep links in discovery and movie detail experiences.
  - TMDb fallback path now accepts provider-aware constraints and US watch-region context.
- **UI foundation normalization**
  - Consolidated app shell header ownership to `src/components/Header.jsx` and removed duplicate inline header implementation in app shell.
  - Added global design-token primitives in `src/index.css` and route-level page-shell normalization in `src/App.css`.
  - Added development safety hardening for Vite HMR/service-worker conflicts to reduce stale-client behavior.
- **Enrichment reliability guardrails**
  - Enrichment fetches now run independently and fail-soft with Promise-settled orchestration so core movie rendering never blocks.
  - Added `.env.example` documentation for enrichment flags.

### ✅ Quality

- Verified production build succeeds after streaming + UI foundation integration (`npm run build`).
- Confirmed roadmap/docs alignment for completed Phase 1/2 implementation and queued Optional API Enrichment phase.

---

## [1.12.6] - April 16, 2026

### 🚀 Added

- **Oracle Analytics admin surface**
  - Added analytics route at `/admin/oracle-analytics` with provider/fallback visibility.
  - Added Oracle analytics API/util wiring and Supabase `oracle_provider_events` migration support.

### 🛠️ Changed

- **Reliability hardening**
  - Added shared-list schema fallback handling for optional columns (`joined_at`, `added_by`) to avoid hard failures across environments.
  - Hardened importer/list insertion fallback when `added_by` is unavailable.
  - Improved service worker offline fallbacks for navigation and cached API responses.

### ✅ Quality

- Follow-up release sync after GitHub push: changelog/version alignment before deployment.

---

## [1.12.5] - April 16, 2026

### 🚀 Added

- **Phase 6.2 Watch History Calendar**
  - Replaced the `/history` timeline with a month calendar grid that highlights watched days.
  - Added day-level drilldown: selecting an active day reveals all movies watched on that date.
  - Added month navigation controls (`Previous`, `Next`) and a `Jump to Today` shortcut.

### 🛠️ Changed

- **Watch History mobile UX polish**
  - Enforced mobile-friendly touch targets (44px minimum) on calendar controls and day cells.
  - Improved small-screen layout density for calendar and selected-day cards for readability and tap comfort.

### ✅ Quality

- Lint checks pass for updated Watch History files.

---

## [1.12.4] - April 15, 2026

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Auth persistence / Remember Me (hardening)**
  - Clear Supabase session keys (`sb-*` and legacy app key) from both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` before each login and after logout so switching Remember Me cannot leave orphaned tokens.
  - Local-only `signOut` before `signInWithPassword` resets in-memory auth without an extra network round trip.
  - `onAuthStateChange` clears app user state only on `SIGNED_OUT`, not on other events with a transient missing session.

### ✅ Quality

- Targeted lint passes for auth/session files.
- Production build succeeds (`npm run build`).

---

## [1.12.3] - April 15, 2026

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Auth persistence / unexpected logout**
  - Fixed Remember Me behavior by wiring auth persistence to a deterministic storage preference used by the Supabase storage adapter.
  - Removed unsupported `persistSession` login option usage from sign-in flow and centralized storage preference handling.
  - Default logout now resets preference back to local persistence for the next login session.

### ✅ Quality

- Targeted lint passes for auth/session files.
- Production build succeeds (`npm run build`).

---

## [1.12.2] - April 15, 2026

### 🛠️ Changed

- **Scanner discoverability**
  - Added a primary `📷 Scan Barcode` CTA in the Library header, directly beside `✨ Magic Import`.
  - CTA opens `LogMovieModal` in scan-first mode so users can immediately scan and save from the main Library action row.
- **Scan flow validation**
  - Added a guard in `LogMovieModal` to prevent saving placeholder entries before a valid movie is identified via scanner/lookup.

---

## [1.12.1] - April 15, 2026

### 🛠️ Changed

- **Scanner compatibility hardening**
  - Added browser fallback scanner path in `src/components/LogMovieModal.jsx`: use native `BarcodeDetector` when available, and automatically fall back to `html5-qrcode` when unavailable or when native startup fails.
  - Improved scanner lifecycle cleanup (camera stream + timer + fallback scanner stop/clear) to prevent stuck sessions on mobile.
  - Preserved existing UPC lookup + anti-double-buy integration for both scanner modes.

### 📦 Dependencies

- Added `html5-qrcode` as scanner fallback dependency.

---

## [1.12.0] - April 15, 2026

### 🚀 Added

- **PWA install polish**
  - Added install-prompt UX flow via `beforeinstallprompt` handling (`src/pwa/useInstallPrompt.js`) and app-level install CTA (`src/App.jsx`).
  - Upgraded manifest metadata in `public/manifest.json` and added dedicated app icons (`public/pwa-192.svg`, `public/pwa-512.svg`).
  - Added icon links in `index.html` for stronger installability signals.
- **Scanner MVP + UPC pipeline**
  - Added live camera barcode scanning in `LogMovieModal` using `BarcodeDetector` + rear-camera constraints where available.
  - Added UPC lookup pipeline (`src/api/upc.js`) that resolves barcode data and pre-fills movie context via TMDB search.
  - Wired scanner/lookup output into existing anti-double-buy and UPC integrity save flow.

### 🛠️ Changed

- **Roadmap progress sync**
  - Marked PWA install polish and scanner-integrated anti-double-buy milestones complete in Phase 7 sections.

---

## [1.11.1] - April 15, 2026

### 🛠️ Changed

- **AI provider hardening**
  - Tightened Groq genre-extraction response contract to strict JSON object shape for better parser reliability.
  - Hardened Gemini initialization path to fail clearly when key is missing, allowing fallback flow to proceed deterministically.
- **Environment setup docs**
  - Added `VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to `.env.example`.
  - Updated `README.md` prerequisites and setup snippet for Groq + OpenRouter key requirements.
- **Infrastructure activation**
  - Applied Phase 7.1 and 7.3 database migrations in Supabase (`oracle_daily_budget`, `movie_logs_upc_integrity`) and verified resulting objects.
  - Added `VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to Vercel Production and Development environments.

---

## [1.11.0] - April 15, 2026

### 🚀 Added

- **Phase 7.1 Oracle hardening**
  - Added provider fallback ladder beyond Gemini with OpenRouter emergency fallback in `src/utils/gemini.js`.
  - Added Oracle budget utility `src/utils/oracleBudget.js` with Supabase RPC-first checks and local fallback counters.
  - Added Supabase migration `20260415170000_oracle_daily_budget.sql` for daily usage tracking + authenticated RPCs.
- **Phase 7.2 PWA + offline foundation**
  - Added service worker `public/sw.js` with app-shell caching and TMDB/OMDb API cache fallback.
  - Added service worker registration via `src/pwa/registerServiceWorker.js` and app bootstrap integration.
  - Added IndexedDB-backed queue `src/utils/offlineQueue.js` for offline movie-log writes with auto flush on reconnect.
- **Phase 7.3 discovery + collection integrity**
  - Added natural-language library query parsing in `src/utils/naturalLanguageSort.js` and integrated it into `LibraryPage`.
  - Added anti-double-buy checks in `AddToListButton` and `LogMovieModal` via `src/utils/collectionIntegrity.js`.
  - Added UPC integrity migration `20260415173000_movie_logs_upc_integrity.sql` and optional UPC field in log modal.

### 🛠️ Changed

- **Discovery context hydration**
  - Oracle request context now prioritizes Top 20 watched + Last 5 to-watch + curated list items before prompt assembly.
- **Offline UX**
  - Library and Discovery now display offline-state messaging for clearer behavior when disconnected.
- **Sync behavior**
  - App root now attempts queued-log flush on startup and when network connectivity returns.

---

## [1.10.1] - April 15, 2026

### 🚀 Added

- **Username foundation for social/collaboration flows**
  - Added migration `20260415143000_username_foundation.sql` to enforce `profiles.username` consistency.
  - Backfills missing usernames, enforces lowercase/format validation, and adds a case-insensitive unique index.
  - Added RPC `is_username_available(p_username, p_exclude_user_id)` for frontend availability checks.

### 🛠️ Changed

- **Registration**
  - Sign-up now includes a required `username` field.
  - Validates username format and checks availability before account creation.
  - Persists username in both `auth.user_metadata` and `profiles`.
- **Profile Settings**
  - Added editable username field alongside display name.
  - Username updates now validate format + uniqueness before save.
- **Utilities**
  - Added `src/api/usernames.js` with normalization/validation/availability helpers.

### ✅ Quality

- Lint passes cleanly (`npm run lint`)
- Production build succeeds (`npm run build`)

---

## [1.10.0] - April 15, 2026

### 🚀 Added

- **Phase 6.17 MVP — Collaborative Shared Lists**
  - **Invite system (owner-only)**: owners can invite collaborators by UUID, email, or username from list detail.
  - **Role model**: collaborators support `owner`, `editor`, and `viewer` permissions with role update/remove controls.
  - **Membership-aware list loading**: shared lists now appear across Library and Add-to-List flows (not just owned lists).
  - **Attribution metadata**: list items include `added_by` profile context for per-item “Added by …” display.
  - **Realtime sync**: active shared list auto-refreshes when collaborators mutate `list_items`.

### 🛠️ Changed

- **ListContext now shared-aware**
  - Added role helpers (`isListOwner`, `canEditList`) and collaborator actions (`inviteCollaborator`, `changeCollaboratorRole`, `removeCollaborator`).
  - List creation and item mutation paths now use shared-list API patterns and role checks.
- **Library UI**
  - Added collaborators panel in list detail with invite input, role badges, role editing, and removal actions.
  - “My Lists” tab label updated to **Lists** and list cards now indicate owner/shared role context.
- **Action Menu Sync**
  - `AddToListButton` and Oracle discovery quick-add now include shared lists.
  - Viewer-role lists are visible but disabled for edits with explicit viewer indicators.

### ✅ Quality

- Lint passes cleanly (`npm run lint`)
- Production build succeeds (`npm run build`)

---

## [1.9.6] - April 15, 2026

### 🚀 Added

- **Phase 6.18.5 — Crew deep navigation on Movie Detail**
  - **Hero**: “Directed by” and “Written by” lines with links to `/actor/:id` (deduped from TMDB `credits.crew`)
  - **Behind the camera**: New section for featured roles (Director of Photography, Editor, Original Music Composer, Production Design) with the same poster grid + links as Cast
- Cast section was already linked; this completes person-profile navigation for key crew

---

## [1.9.5] - April 15, 2026

### 🧰 Added

- **ESLint** (flat `eslint.config.js`) for Vite + React: `eslint`, `@eslint/js`, `eslint-plugin-react`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, `eslint-plugin-react-refresh`, `globals`
- **Scripts**: `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix`
- **Lint scope**: `src/` only; build output, `node_modules`, `scripts/`, and `*.config.js` ignored

### 🐛 Fixed (found by lint)

- **Header.jsx** — Added missing `useNavigate` import; merged duplicate `onClick` on mobile Oracle button
- **DiscoveryPage.jsx** — Removed invalid conditional `useToast()` call (hooks must run unconditionally)
- **OracleOverlay.jsx** — Dropped unused default React import (JSX runtime)

---

## [1.9.4] - April 14, 2026

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Supabase `/lists` HTTP 500** — RLS on `lists` and `list_members` was still mutually recursive (`lists` queried `list_members`, owner policy on `list_members` queried `lists`). Replaced those checks with `SECURITY DEFINER` helpers (`list_owned_by_user`, `user_is_member_of_list`, `user_can_edit_shared_list`) so membership/ownership checks do not re-enter RLS. Updated `list_items` policy to use the same pattern.
- **Movie detail log noise** — Removed the `console.log` for the normal “no log yet” case; `userLog` is now cleared with `setUserLog(null)` when there is no row.

### ℹ️ Notes (not app bugs)

## [1.9.3] - April 14, 2026

### 🚀 Added

- **Actor Filmography Filters (Phase 6.18.4)** — Smart filtering on person profile pages:
  - **Genre chips** — Only genres present in this actor’s loaded credits; multi-select uses OR logic (match any selected genre).
  - **Decade chips** — Filter by release decade (Pre-1970 through 2030s) when applicable.
  - **Logged only** — Show credits you’ve already logged (requires sign-in).
  - **Clear filters** — One control to reset genre, decade, and logged-only state.
  - **Sticky filter bar** — On viewports ≤768px, filters stick to the top while scrolling the grid (solid background, no bleed-through).
- **Larger credit sample** — Filmography list increased from 40 to 150 TMDB cast entries (poster + popularity sorted) so filters have more to work with.
