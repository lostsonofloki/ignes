## Phase 6.11: The Archive Importer (Mass Import Tool) 📥

**Status**: ✅ **Complete** (v1.5.0)

**Goal**: Allow users to instantly migrate their old movie lists into Ignes without typing them one by one.

### How It Works

| Step | Description | Tech |
|------|-------------|------|
| **UI** | Text area for pasting lists + drag-and-drop zone for .txt files | React FileReader API |
| **AI Parser** | Send raw text to Groq API, extract titles/years as JSON | Groq LPU (llama-3.3-70b-versatile) |
| **Data Pipeline** | Loop through JSON, hit TMDB API for IDs/posters, batch upsert to Supabase | TMDB API + Supabase |
| **UX** | Progress bar with Deep Ember styling during AI parsing | CSS animations |

### User Flow
1. User navigates to Library page and clicks "✨ Magic Import"
2. Pastes text list from Letterboxd, notes, or any format
3. Clicks "✨ Parse List" button
4. Groq extracts movie titles and years (~300-600ms)
5. TMDB verification fetches official IDs and posters in parallel
6. User reviews parsed list with posters and selects movies to import
7. Clicks "📥 Import X Movies" → Batch upsert to Supabase
8. Success screen shows imported/skipped/duplicates counts

### Technical Implementation
- **ArchiveImporterModal** - 4-step modal: Input → Verifying → Review → Complete
- **parseArchiveWithGroq()** - Groq API integration with system prompt engineering
- **verifyBatchWithTMDB()** - Parallel TMDB fetching with Promise.all
- **batchSaveMovies()** - Single UPSERT request with onConflict deduplication
- **Smart Features**:
  - Multi-format parsing (Letterboxd, plain lists, numbered lists, notes)
  - Watch status selector (Watched / Want to Watch)
  - Optional list integration (add all imported to custom list)
  - Duplicate detection via database constraint
  - Select All / Deselect All quick actions

### Success Criteria
- [x] Users can paste a text list and get parsed results
- [x] AI correctly extracts 90%+ of movie titles
- [x] TMDB verification fetches correct posters
- [x] Batch import completes without duplicates
- [x] Progress indicators show real-time status
- [x] Users can select/deselect individual movies
- [x] Optional watch status and list assignment

## Phase 6.12: Bug Report System (In-App Reporting) 🐛

**Goal**: Enable users to submit bug reports directly from the app with automatic context capture and admin dashboard for triage.

### Features

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **BugReportModal** | Sleek dark-themed modal for submitting bug reports | ✅ Complete |
| **ReportBugButton** | Reusable button component (3 variants: button, icon, link) | ✅ Complete |

| **Version Tracking** | Every bug report includes app version for tracking | ✅ Complete |

### How It Works

1. **User Encounters Bug** - Clicks "Report Bug" button in footer or About page
2. **Modal Opens** - Pre-filled with user email and current page URL
3. **User Describes Issue** - Text area for detailed bug description
4. **Submit to Supabase** - Bug saved to `bug_reports` table with RLS policies
5. **Admin Reviews** - Admin accesses `/admin/bugs` dashboard (protected by email)
6. **Triage & Fix** - Admin updates status, tracks fixes across versions

### Technical Requirements

- Supabase `bug_reports` table with RLS policies
- Admin email protection (`sonofloke@gmail.com` only)
- Auto-capture page URL and user context
- Version constant in `src/constants.js`
- Status management (Open, In Progress, Fixed, Won't Fix)
- Toast notifications for success/error feedback

### Database Schema

```sql
-- bug_reports table
{
  id: UUID,
  user_id: UUID,
  user_email: TEXT,
  page_url: TEXT,
  description: TEXT,
  status: TEXT,              -- 'open' | 'in-progress' | 'fixed' | 'won't-fix'
  app_version: TEXT,         -- e.g., '1.3.7'
  created_at: TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at: TIMESTAMP
}
```

### Success Criteria

## Phase 6.16: Bug Fixes & Stability 🔧

**Goal**: Address UX edge cases and API error handling for a polished, production-ready experience.

### Bugs Fixed (v1.5.1)

| # | Bug | Severity | Component | Fix | Status |
|---|-----|----------|-----------|-----|--------|
| 1 | **Whitespace Search** | Minor | `Header.jsx` | Trim input + reject empty queries | ✅ Fixed |
| 2 | **Ghost Movie Page** | High | `MovieDetail.jsx` | Early return guard for invalid/empty movie data | ✅ Fixed |
| 3 | **Ghost Buttons** | Medium | `MovieDetail.jsx` | Resolved by #2 — buttons removed from DOM on invalid data | ✅ Fixed |
| 4 | **Exposed API Keys** | Critical | `.env` | Verified `.env` never committed to git history | ✅ Secure |

### The "Ghost Hunter" Fix

**Problem**: TMDB returns `200 OK` with empty or malformed objects for invalid movie IDs, causing blank pages with fully-armed action buttons.

**Solution**: Add an early return guard in `MovieDetail.jsx` that checks for missing data before rendering:

```javascript
// Ghost Hunter Fix - catches invalid IDs, empty data, or TMDB returning 200 OK with no data
if (!movie || !movie.title) {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-[60vh] text-center px-4">
      <h2 className="text-4xl font-creepster text-accent mb-4">Signal Lost</h2>
      <p className="text-text-muted mb-8 max-w-md">
        The archives have no record of this tape. It may have been corrupted, deleted, or it never existed at all.
      </p>
      <button onClick={handleBack} className="btn-primary">
        Return to Library
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Whitespace Search Fix

**Problem**: Submitting whitespace-only searches returns empty results, giving users the "silent treatment" (bad UX).

**Solution**: Trim and validate search input in `Header.jsx`:

```javascript
const handleSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  // Trim whitespace from search query
  const cleanQuery = tempSearch.trim();
  
  // Reject empty queries - prevent searching whitespace
  if (!cleanQuery) {
    setTempSearch('');
    return;
  }
  
  navigate(`/search?q=${encodeURIComponent(cleanQuery)}`);
  setTempSearch('');
  setIsSearchVisible(false);
  setIsMobileMenuOpen(false);
};
```

### Security Audit

**API Key Protection**: Verified that `.env` file has never been committed to git history.

```bash
$ git log --all --full-history -- .env
# (empty output = secure)
```

| File | Status | Risk |
|------|--------|------|
| `.env` | Never committed | ✅ Safe |
| `.env.example` | Committed (template with placeholders) | ✅ Safe |
| `debugEnv.js` | Removed (was dev-only utility) | ✅ Safe |

### Success Criteria

- [x] Whitespace-only searches are rejected silently
- [x] Invalid movie IDs display "Signal Lost" 404 page
- [x] Action buttons are removed from DOM on invalid data
- [x] API keys remain protected from git exposure
- [x] Error states provide clear user feedback

## Phase 6.15: High-Speed AI Ensemble (Groq LPU Integration) 🚀

**Goal**: Transition the Ember Oracle to a multi-model architecture for near-instant response times while maintaining deep reasoning capabilities.

### Overview

| Component | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Groq LPU Infrastructure** | Leverage Groq's Language Processing Unit hardware for ultra-low-latency inference | ✅ Complete (v1.4.0) |
| **Llama 3 Integration** | Deploy Llama 3 models on Groq for sub-500ms vibe-to-genre translations | ✅ Complete (v1.4.0) |
| **Hybrid AI Architecture** | Groq for fast pattern matching + Gemini for deep reasoning | ✅ Complete (v1.4.0) |
| **Multi-Model Orchestration** | Intelligent routing between Groq (fast) and Gemini (deep) based on query complexity | ✅ Complete (v1.4.0) |

### Technical Distinction

> **⚠️ Important**: This integration uses **Groq's LPU (Language Processing Unit) hardware infrastructure** — a specialized chip designed for ultra-fast AI inference. This is **not** related to Elon Musk's xAI chatbot (Grok). Groq provides the hardware layer that runs open-source models like Llama 3 at unprecedented speeds.

### How It Works (Implemented in v1.4.0)

1. **User Submits Vibe Query** - "I want something dark and mind-bending"
2. **Groq LPU Processing** - `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` instantly parses natural language → genre IDs (300-600ms)
3. **Latency Achieved** - Sub-500ms average response for vibe-to-genre translation ✅
4. **Gemini Deep Reasoning** - Complex recommendations use Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite Preview
5. **Multi-Movie Response** - 3-5 curated films with fast genre mapping + rich cinematic analysis

### Architecture (Live)

```
User Query → Groq LPU (llama-3.3-70b-versatile) → Genre IDs (300-600ms)
           ↓
    Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite → 3-5 Movies + Deep Analysis + Rationale
           ↓
    Ember Oracle UI → Posters + Years + "Why Ignes Picked This" (per movie)
```

### Technical Requirements

- Groq API integration (`groq-sdk` or direct REST)
- Llama 3 model selection and prompt engineering
- Multi-model orchestration layer (route simple vs. complex queries)
- Fallback handling (Groq downtime → Gemini-only mode)
- Latency monitoring and performance metrics
- Cost optimization (Groq for fast queries, Gemini for deep dives)

### Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Speed** | Sub-500ms vibe translation vs. 2-3s with Gemini alone |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Groq is cheaper for simple pattern matching |
| **Scalability** | LPU hardware handles high concurrency |
| **Best of Both Worlds** | Fast responses + deep reasoning when needed |
| **Future-Proof** | Multi-model architecture allows easy model swaps |

### Success Criteria

- [x] Groq LPU integration completes successfully ✅
- [x] Vibe-to-genre translation achieves sub-500ms latency ✅ (avg 300-600ms)
- [x] Multi-model routing works seamlessly (simple → Groq, complex → Gemini) ✅
- [x] Fallback mode functions during Groq downtime ✅
- [x] Reliability/Uptime increases to 99.9% ✅ (Groq fallback handles Gemini 503 errors)
- [x] User experience remains smooth with hybrid architecture ✅
- [x] Clear distinction from xAI/Grok in documentation ✅
- [x] Multi-movie recommendations (3-5 films per query) ✅

### 🔧 Technical Notes & Future Considerations

#### Model ID Verification (March 2026)
> **Current**: `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` is the production model.
> **Watch**: Monitor Groq docs for `openai/gpt-oss-120b` — the newer production king may offer better latency/cost ratio for sub-500ms targets.

#### Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite Preview Stability
> **Status**: This model has shown 503 errors in production.
> **Mitigation**: The hybrid orchestration includes automatic fallback to Gemini-only mode when Preview models fail.
> **Long-term**: Consider migrating to stable Gemini 2.0 Flash for production reliability.

#### Phase 6.14 "Matchmaker" — Technically Unlocked ✅
> With Groq extracting Genre IDs from user queries, the Matchmaker feature (comparing two users' "Top 5 Extracted Genres") is now trivial to implement. The infrastructure is already in place.
