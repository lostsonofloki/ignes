| --- | ------------------------------ | -------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 1   | **Matchmaker 400/406 Errors**  | High     | `Supabase SQL`   | Added explicit Foreign Keys connecting `friendships` to `profiles` table.                                               | ✅ Fixed |
| 2   | **Matchmaker White Screen**    | Critical | `Matchmaker.jsx` | Added Optional Chaining (`?.`) and stable `ui-avatars.com` fallbacks to prevent crashes on null profiles.               | ✅ Fixed |
| 3   | **0% Synergy (Privacy Lock)**  | High     | `Supabase RLS`   | Fixed RLS policy on `movie_logs` using `::uuid` casting to allow friends to view each other's libraries for comparison. | ✅ Fixed |
| 4   | **Schema Naming Conflict**     | High     | `Database`       | Reconciled `poster` vs `poster_path` by creating a Generated Virtual Column, and ensured `genres` column exists.        | ✅ Fixed |
| 5   | **Discover 'Add to List' 400** | High     | `Discover.jsx`   | Stripped `genres` from the insert payload to prevent Postgres type-casting rejections on quick-adds.                    | ✅ Fixed |
| 6   | **Gemini Parsing Crash**       | Medium   | `AI API`         | Switched from `gemini-1.5-flash-lite-preview` to stable `gemini-1.5-flash` to prevent 503 stream drops.                 | ✅ Fixed |

### The "Ghost Hunter" Fix

**Problem**: TMDB returns `200 OK` with empty or malformed objects for invalid movie IDs, causing blank pages with fully-armed action buttons.

**Solution**: Add an early return guard in `MovieDetail.jsx` that checks for missing data before rendering:

```javascript
// Ghost Hunter Fix - catches invalid IDs, empty data, or TMDB returning 200 OK with no data
if (!movie || !movie.title) {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center min-h-[60vh] text-center px-4">
      <h2 className="text-4xl font-creepster text-accent mb-4">Signal Lost</h2>
      <p className="text-text-muted mb-8 max-w-md">
        The archives have no record of this tape. It may have been corrupted,
        deleted, or it never existed at all.
      </p>
      <button onClick={handleBack} className="btn-primary">
        Return to Library
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Whitespace Search Fix

**Problem**: Submitting whitespace-only searches returns empty results, giving users the "silent treatment" (bad UX).

**Solution**: Trim and validate search input in `Header.jsx`:

```javascript
const handleSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();

  // Trim whitespace from search query
  const cleanQuery = tempSearch.trim();

  // Reject empty queries - prevent searching whitespace
  if (!cleanQuery) {
    setTempSearch("");
    return;
  }

  navigate(`/search?q=${encodeURIComponent(cleanQuery)}`);
  setTempSearch("");
  setIsSearchVisible(false);
  setIsMobileMenuOpen(false);
};
```

### Security Audit

**API Key Protection**: Verified that `.env` file has never been committed to git history.

```bash
$ git log --all --full-history -- .env
# (empty output = secure)
```

| File           | Status                                 | Risk    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `.env`         | Never committed                        | ✅ Safe |
| `.env.example` | Committed (template with placeholders) | ✅ Safe |
| `debugEnv.js`  | Removed (was dev-only utility)         | ✅ Safe |

### Success Criteria

- [x] Whitespace-only searches are rejected silently
- [x] Invalid movie IDs display "Signal Lost" 404 page
- [x] Action buttons are removed from DOM on invalid data
- [x] API keys remain protected from git exposure
- [x] Error states provide clear user feedback

## Phase 6.15: High-Speed AI Ensemble (Groq LPU Integration) 🚀

**Goal**: Transition the Oracle to a multi-model architecture for near-instant response times while maintaining deep reasoning capabilities.

### Overview

| Component                     | Description                                                                         | Status               |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Groq LPU Infrastructure**   | Leverage Groq's Language Processing Unit hardware for ultra-low-latency inference   | ✅ Complete (v1.4.0) |
| **Llama 3 Integration**       | Deploy Llama 3 models on Groq for sub-500ms vibe-to-genre translations              | ✅ Complete (v1.4.0) |
| **Hybrid AI Architecture**    | Groq for fast pattern matching + Gemini for deep reasoning                          | ✅ Complete (v1.4.0) |
| **Multi-Model Orchestration** | Intelligent routing between Groq (fast) and Gemini (deep) based on query complexity | ✅ Complete (v1.4.0) |

### Technical Distinction

> **⚠️ Important**: This integration uses **Groq's LPU (Language Processing Unit) hardware infrastructure** — a specialized chip designed for ultra-fast AI inference. This is **not** related to Elon Musk's xAI chatbot (Grok). Groq provides the hardware layer that runs open-source models like Llama 3 at unprecedented speeds.

### How It Works (Implemented in v1.4.0)

1. **User Submits Vibe Query** - "I want something dark and mind-bending"
2. **Groq LPU Processing** - `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` instantly parses natural language → genre IDs (300-600ms)
3. **Latency Achieved** - Sub-500ms average response for vibe-to-genre translation ✅
4. **Gemini Deep Reasoning** - Complex recommendations use Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite Preview
5. **Multi-Movie Response** - 3-5 curated films with fast genre mapping + rich cinematic analysis

### Architecture (Live)

```
User Query → Groq LPU (llama-3.3-70b-versatile) → Genre IDs (300-600ms)
           ↓
    Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite → 3-5 Movies + Deep Analysis + Rationale
           ↓
    Oracle UI → Posters + Years + "Why Filmgraph Picked This" (per movie)
```

### Technical Requirements

- Groq API integration (`groq-sdk` or direct REST)
- Llama 3 model selection and prompt engineering
- Multi-model orchestration layer (route simple vs. complex queries)
- Fallback handling (Groq downtime → Gemini-only mode)
- Latency monitoring and performance metrics
- Cost optimization (Groq for fast queries, Gemini for deep dives)

### Benefits

| Benefit                 | Description                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Speed**               | Sub-500ms vibe translation vs. 2-3s with Gemini alone |
| **Cost Efficiency**     | Groq is cheaper for simple pattern matching           |
| **Scalability**         | LPU hardware handles high concurrency                 |
| **Best of Both Worlds** | Fast responses + deep reasoning when needed           |
| **Future-Proof**        | Multi-model architecture allows easy model swaps      |

### Success Criteria

- [x] Groq LPU integration completes successfully ✅
- [x] Vibe-to-genre translation achieves sub-500ms latency ✅ (avg 300-600ms)
- [x] Multi-model routing works seamlessly (simple → Groq, complex → Gemini) ✅
- [x] Fallback mode functions during Groq downtime ✅
- [x] Reliability/Uptime increases to 99.9% ✅ (Groq fallback handles Gemini 503 errors)
- [x] User experience remains smooth with hybrid architecture ✅
- [x] Clear distinction from xAI/Grok in documentation ✅
- [x] Multi-movie recommendations (3-5 films per query) ✅

### 🔧 Technical Notes & Future Considerations

#### Model ID Verification (March 2026)

> **Current**: `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` is the production model.
> **Watch**: Monitor Groq docs for `openai/gpt-oss-120b` — the newer production king may offer better latency/cost ratio for sub-500ms targets.

#### Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite Preview Stability

> **Status**: This model has shown 503 errors in production.
> **Mitigation**: The hybrid orchestration includes automatic fallback to Gemini-only mode when Preview models fail.
> **Long-term**: Consider migrating to stable Gemini 2.0 Flash for production reliability.

#### Phase 6.14 "Matchmaker" — Technically Unlocked ✅

> With Groq extracting Genre IDs from user queries, the Matchmaker feature (comparing two users' "Top 5 Extracted Genres") is now trivial to implement. The infrastructure is already in place.

## Phase 7.6: UX/UI Overhaul (Premium Product Pass) 🎬

**Status**: 🛠️ **Planned**
**Priority**: 🔥 **High (Active Focus)**

**Goal**: Evolve Filmgraph from a functional tracker into a premium-feeling, mobile-first product by removing friction, tightening hierarchy, and standardizing visual language.

### Design Principles

- **Anti-Homework UX**: Curated, atmospheric presentation over spreadsheet-like density.
- **Mobile-First**: Core navigation and logging actions must be one-thumb accessible.
- **Token Consistency**: Colors, spacing, radius, and elevation must follow one system across all pages.
- **Friction First**: Reduce taps and modal dependency in the primary log/discover loop.

### Priority Execution Order

| Order | Track | Why | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Design Token Normalization** | Removes "slapped together" feel across the whole app quickly. | ✅ |
| 2 | **Bottom Navigation (Mobile/PWA)** | Biggest usability win for daily navigation and thumb reach. | ✅ |
| 3 | **Direct Card Actions** | Reduces logging friction and modal overhead. | ✅ |
| 4 | **Profile Hierarchy Cleanup** | Improves readability and reduces stat clutter. | ✅ |
| 5 | **Watch History Photographic Calendar** | Increases emotional recall and visual identity. | ✅ |
| 6 | **Founders Presentation Surface** | Strengthens launch positioning without polluting core flows. | ✅ |

### Tasks

| 7.6.4 | **Oracle Hero Treatment** | Upgrade Oracle surface with premium container styling and progressive response reveal motion. | ✅ |
| 7.6.5 | **Profile Simplification** | Surface top three metrics first (total films, this-year watched, avg rating), move secondary stats below. | ✅ |
| 7.6.6 | **Photographic History Calendar** | Represent watched days with poster-driven cells while preserving date navigation and accessibility. | ✅ |
| 7.6.7 | **Founders UX Surface** | Add a focused Founders panel/landing section and premium badge presentation for early users. | ✅ |
| 7.6.8 | **Motion + Microinteraction Pass** | Normalize transitions, hover states, loading behavior, and button feedback across key routes. | ✅ |

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Primary CTA is visually obvious within 2 seconds on Discover, Library, and Profile.
- [ ] Core mobile nav no longer depends on the hamburger menu for top journeys.
- [ ] User can add a movie to watchlist/log from a card in <= 2 taps.
- [ ] Visual hierarchy remains clear in grayscale/squint test across core pages.
- [ ] Shared token system is applied consistently across updated components.

### Out of Scope (Initial 7.6 Pass)

## Phase 7.7: UPC Cache Reliability Layer

**Status**: 🚧 **In Progress**
**Priority**: 🔥 **High (Active Focus)**

**Goal**: Reduce repeated external UPC lookups by introducing a server-side `upc_cache` table and read-through cache behavior in the UPC proxy.

### Tasks

| # | Task | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7.7.1 | **Schema Add** | Add `upc_cache` table with lookup payload and freshness metadata columns. | ✅ |
| 7.7.2 | **Proxy Read-Through** | Read cache first in `api/upc-lookup.js`, call upstream only on miss. | ✅ |
| 7.7.3 | **Cache Upsert** | Persist normalized payload after upstream success with non-blocking writes. | ✅ |
| 7.7.4 | **Env + Ops Docs** | Document required server env vars for cache access in `.env.example`. | ✅ |
| 7.7.5 | **Verification Pass** | Validate repeated scans return faster and fail-soft behavior remains intact. | ✅ |

### Success Criteria

- [x] Re-scanning the same UPC avoids repeated upstream API calls.
- [x] Cache write failures never block UPC lookup responses.
- [x] Mobile scanner flow remains unchanged from user perspective (faster on repeat scans).

| 7.8.2 | **Unique Membership Guard** | Enforce `list_members(list_id,user_id)` uniqueness with defensive dedupe migration and race-safe upsert writes. | ✅ |
| 7.8.3 | **Streaming Badges** | Show matched provider logos on Oracle result cards based on user provider preferences. | ✅ |

### Success Criteria

- [x] Rerolling a single recommendation updates only that card.
- [x] Collaborator list views no longer show duplicate list entries from duplicate membership rows.
- [x] Oracle cards display only streaming logos that match `user_providers`.

## Phase 7.9: Oracle Intelligence Pass 🧠

**Status**: ✅ **Complete (Sprints A-C + follow-ons shipped)**
**Priority**: ✅ **Shipped**

**Goal**: Make Oracle recommendations smarter, stricter, and more resilient by enforcing post-generation quality checks and improving recommendation relevance.

> **Execution Note**: Sprint A/B/C integration shipped first, followed by `7.9.4` telemetry expansion and `7.9.5` provider-aware ranking in the same stabilization pass.

### Ranked Implementation Order (Now / Next / Later)

#### Now (highest ROI)

- **Natural-language Oracle filters**
  - Goal: Support compound queries like "pre-1960 horror on my watchlist" with year/genre/library-state constraints.
  - Done when: Oracle reliably parses and applies at least year + genre + watch-status filters in one request.
- **Prompt + taste-profile weighting refinement**
  - Goal: Improve relevance using stronger weighting for moods, genre affinity, rating polarity, and recency.
  - Done when: Prompt context consistently includes weighted taste signals and avoids low-rated lookalikes.
- **Reliability hardening**
  - Goal: Reduce failed responses/timeouts under provider instability.
  - Done when: Oracle maintains stable fallback behavior and provider failures no longer produce user-facing dead-ends.

#### Next (high value, broader scope)

- **Provider freshness + relevance ranking**
  - Goal: Rank recommendations by likelihood of immediate availability on selected services.
  - Done when: Result ordering prioritizes watch-now options and tracks conversion impact.
- **TV expansion groundwork**
  - Goal: Extend Oracle to series-level TV discovery while keeping movie flow stable.
  - Done when: Movie/TV media-type routing and recommendation verification support both surfaces.
- **List overlap intelligence ("Matchmaker for Lists")**
  - Goal: Find intersections across personal and curated lists to drive higher-intent discovery.
  - Done when: Users can query overlap sets (for example, Criterion vs Watchlist) from discovery workflows.

#### Later (differentiation / polish)

- **Oracle hero interaction polish**
  - Goal: Make discovery feel premium with progressive reveal animation and richer visual treatment.
  - Done when: Motion and hierarchy improvements ship without adding interaction friction.
- **Group discovery ("Porch Talk" protocol)**
  - Goal: Convert solo discovery into consensus-ready group viewing workflows.
  - Done when: Bracket-based group voting and winner surfacing are available for shared sessions.

### Deferred Sprint Checklist (Now Track)

#### Sprint A — Query Intelligence

- [x] Implement compound natural-language parsing for Oracle (year range + genre + library-state in a single query).
- [x] Add deterministic constraint mapping for `watch_status` and decade/year filters before model call.
- [x] Add validation tests for representative prompts (for example: "pre-1960 horror on my watchlist").
- [x] Ship behind a safe toggle so fallback Oracle behavior remains available (`VITE_FEATURE_ORACLE_QUERY_CONSTRAINTS=true`).

#### Sprint B — Taste Weighting

- [x] Expand taste-profile weighting rules for mood affinity, genre repetition, rating polarity, and recency.
- [x] Encode "avoid-like" signals from low-rated watched logs directly into prompt context.
- [x] Cap and prioritize context slices to prevent token bloat while preserving relevance.
- [x] Verify recommendation quality on seeded user personas (cozy, noir, deep-cuts, mind-bending).
- [x] Add server-side taste-profile RPC (`get_oracle_taste_profile`) with fail-soft local fallback (`VITE_FEATURE_ORACLE_TASTE_RPC=true`).
- [x] Add fast Groq intent-parser lane for Oracle constraints with deterministic-parser fallback (`VITE_FEATURE_ORACLE_GROQ_INTENT_PARSER=true`).

#### Sprint C — Reliability Hardening

- [x] Add stricter timeout/retry behavior per provider with clear fallback reason tagging.
- [x] Ensure Oracle never returns an empty user-facing state when at least one provider path is healthy.
- [x] Add observability for failure mode buckets (rate-limit, parse-fail, timeout, upstream unavailable).
- [x] Run regression pass for discover, reroll-one, and reroll-all flows under simulated provider failures.

### Tasks

| # | Task | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7.9.1 | **Post-Generation Guardrails** | Normalize and validate recommendation payloads (dedupe, rejected-title exclusion, schema safety). | ✅ |
| 7.9.2 | **Quality Floor Enforcement** | Enforce 3-5 high-quality recommendations and top-up with deterministic fallback when model output is thin. | ✅ |
| 7.9.3 | **Cross-Provider Consistency** | Apply the same guardrails to Gemini and OpenRouter responses before UI render. | ✅ |
| 7.9.4 | **Oracle Telemetry Expansion** | Add smarter quality metrics (dedupe drops, rejection-violation attempts, post-filter counts) plus provider-attempt traces (`provider_attempts` JSON) with additive `oracle_provider_events` compatibility. | ✅ |
| 7.9.5 | **Provider-Aware Relevance Ranking** | Prioritize suggestions likely available on selected streaming providers before final card ordering. | ✅ |
| 7.9.6 | **Taste-Profile Context Hydration** | Build richer user taste context from moods, genres, ratings, decades, recency, and avoid-signals before Oracle generation. | ✅ |

### Success Criteria

- [x] Duplicate titles are removed before Oracle cards render.
- [x] Rejected titles are excluded with case-insensitive matching.
- [x] Oracle returns a stable 3-5 recommendation set whenever providers are available.
- [x] Oracle prompt context reflects user vibe patterns (moods/genres/ratings/decades/recency), not just raw title history.
- [x] Analytics captures recommendation quality signals for ongoing tuning.
- [x] Provider-aware ranking prioritizes provider-matched results while preserving reorder-only behavior and reroll index safety.

## Phase 8: Multi-Media Expansion (TV Shows) 📺

**Status**: 🛠️ **Planned**
**Priority**: ⚪ **Medium (Post-Launch)**

**Goal**: Expand Filmgraph from movie-only tracking into a unified movie + TV experience without fragmenting the existing data and feature model.

### Guiding Decisions

- **Unified Log Model**: Extend `movie_logs` with `media_type` (`movie` | `tv`) instead of creating a separate `tv_logs` table.
- **Series-First MVP**: Start with show-level logging and discovery (episode-level tracking is deferred).
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing logs default to `media_type='movie'` during migration.
- **Route Safety**: Use explicit `/movie/:id` and `/tv/:id` routes mapped to shared detail rendering logic.

### Tasks

| # | Task | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8.1 | **Schema Extension** | Add `movie_logs.media_type` and enforce uniqueness on `(user_id, tmdb_id, media_type)`. | ⬜ |
| 8.2 | **List Compatibility** | Extend list item uniqueness to include `media_type` to avoid TMDB ID collisions across movie/TV. | ⬜ |
| 8.3 | **TMDB TV Endpoints** | Add TV adapters for search, details, watch providers, and recommendations. | ⬜ |
| 8.4 | **Shared Detail View** | Refactor detail surface to support both movie and TV payloads safely. | ⬜ |
| 8.5 | **Search + Discovery UI** | Add media-type toggles across Search and Oracle discovery flows. | ⬜ |
| 8.6 | **Library + Lists UX** | Enable filtering, logging, and list operations for TV entries. | ⬜ |
| 8.7 | **Oracle TV Support** | Extend recommendation prompt and verification flow for `media_type='tv'`. | ⬜ |
| 8.8 | **SEO + Sitemap** | Add TV metadata strategy (`TVSeries` JSON-LD) and optional `/tv/:id` sitemap entries. | ⬜ |
| 8.9 | **Importer Parity** | Support TV title ingestion in Magic Importer parsing/verification pipeline. | ⬜ |
| 8.10 | **Scanner Scope Definition** | Keep barcode flow movie-first in MVP and document TV physical media handling as follow-up work. | ⬜ |

### Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can search, open, and log TV series entries.
- [ ] Library/list workflows treat movie + TV entries consistently.
- [ ] No cross-type duplicate conflicts (`movie` vs `tv`) on TMDB IDs.
- [ ] Existing movie-only behavior remains stable after migration.

### Out of Scope (Initial Phase 8)

- Per-episode logging and progress tracking.
- Season-specific provider availability logic.
- Calendar support for episode air dates.
- Matchmaker weighting updates based on mixed media logs.
